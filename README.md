This is the first trivial project built while enrolled in the web development bootcamp at the University of Denver. It queries the TicketMaster API with a search term to serve results specific to Denver, CO. Results are stored in a Firebase datastore and rendered on a map with the Google Maps API. Limited animation was implemented with slick.js.
